The slash/application command handler which I use. It's a modified version from [this handler](https://github.com/Nathaniel-VFX/Discord.js-v14-Command-Handlers), which is made by [Nathaniel-VFX](https://github.com/Nathaniel-VFX). He (or she/something else, idk tbh) did an amazing job.

I did change some stuff like add config files for colors, emojis and default embeds and overal changed it a bit to my needs & way of doing things. I decided to put it on GitHub to make it easy for me to clone the handler for my projects (_which I won't ever finish_). Feel free to use it

I'm planning on adding more branches for e.g MySQL & multiple languages.
